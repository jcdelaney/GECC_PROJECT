Overview
========

This repository contains two directories, animalGoNoGo and PPVT, each containing all the code for each experiment. The code for both experiments is built from the same framework so you will find that both are fairly similar in structure. 

List of Files
=============

Files that you will be working with often:

 - *nameofexperiment*.m - This is the main file for the project. It contains all the code to initialize and experiment and calls all the necessary helper functions to conduct the study
 - Trials.m - This file contains the function responsible generating the trials object that is displayed by ShowStimuli. This function also writes this information to a 
  log file. Note, runs.m is also used with trials.m in animal go no go. 
 - ShowStimuli.m - This the file contains the function responsible for displaying a batch of trials to the participant. This takes a trials object, as generated by Trials as an input.

Everything Else:

 - EEAEvents.m - Generates a dictionary of event codes to be sent to the EEG system.
 - ExitStudy.m - Performs all the necessary steps to successfully stop a session.
 - GetTime.m - Returns the current time as a formatted string.
 - lptwrite.m - Writes bytes to ports. Used for communicating with the EEG system.
 - NetStation.m - Handles all communications with NetStation, the EEG software we use.
 - SendTrigger.m - Sends a messages to the EEG system.

Files for testing purposes:

 - KbTest.m
 - PTB_testing.m
 - PTB_text_testing.m
